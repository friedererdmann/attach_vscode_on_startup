1. Make sure you have a virtual environment with ptvsd installed (check `create_venv.bat`)
2. Update `launch_maya.py` with your Maya path
3. Check `scripts/userSetup.py` to decide if you want your file to be run at Maya startup
4. Currently everything defaults to port 7740 (`userSetup.py`, `launch.json`, `tasks.json`)
5. Run `Debug in Maya` configuration
